# Phase 3: Two-Way Messaging - Testing Guide

## 🎯 Overview
This guide covers testing the complete two-way messaging implementation for the Yelp integration. All components have been implemented and are ready for testing.

## 📋 Pre-Testing Requirements

### 1. Database Migration
**CRITICAL**: Run the message table migration before testing:

```bash
cd backend
python migrate_message_schema.py
```

### 2. Verify Agent Configuration
Ensure you have a "Yelp Lead Specialist" agent configured with:
- **Trigger**: `new_lead` event
- **Prompt Template**: Uses variables like `{first_name}`, `{service_requested}`, etc.
- **Active Status**: `is_active = true`

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Yelp Lead Creation with Initial Message

**Test**: Verify that creating a Yelp lead triggers an agent session and initial greeting message.

**API Call**:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/webhooks/zapier/yelp-lead-created" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "test-yelp-lead-123",
    "business_id": "test-business-456",
    "conversation_id": "test-conversation-789",
    "time_created": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "last_event_time": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "temporary_email_address": "test@messaging.yelp.com",
    "temporary_phone_number": "+14166666666",
    "user": {
      "display_name": "Sarah Johnson"
    },
    "project": {
      "job_names": ["Kitchen Remodeling"],
      "location": {"postal_code": "12345"},
      "additional_info": "Looking to renovate my kitchen with modern appliances",
      "availability": {
        "status": "SPECIFIC_DATES",
        "dates": ["2024-02-01", "2024-02-02"]
      },
      "survey_answers": [
        {
          "question_text": "What is your budget range?",
          "answer_text": ["$15,000 - $25,000"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

**Expected Results**:
1. ✅ HTTP 200 response with `session_ids` array containing new session ID
2. ✅ New Lead record created with external_id "test-yelp-lead-123"
3. ✅ New AgentSession created with status "active"
4. ✅ Initial Message generated and stored in messages table
5. ✅ Message content uses agent's prompt template with lead variables replaced

**Verification Queries**:
```sql
-- Check lead was created
SELECT * FROM leads WHERE external_id = 'test-yelp-lead-123';

-- Check agent session was created
SELECT * FROM agent_sessions WHERE lead_id = (SELECT id FROM leads WHERE external_id = 'test-yelp-lead-123');

-- Check initial message was generated
SELECT * FROM messages WHERE lead_id = (SELECT id FROM leads WHERE external_id = 'test-yelp-lead-123') AND sender_type = 'agent';
```

### Scenario 2: Incoming Customer Message and Agent Response

**Test**: Verify incoming message routing and automatic agent response generation.

**API Call**:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/webhooks/zapier/yelp-message-received" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "yelp_lead_id": "test-yelp-lead-123",
    "conversation_id": "test-conversation-789",
    "message_content": "Hi! I am interested in getting a quote for my kitchen remodel. When can we schedule a consultation?",
    "sender": "customer",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z"
  }'
```

**Expected Results**:
1. ✅ HTTP 200 response with agent response content in `message` field
2. ✅ Customer message persisted in messages table
3. ✅ Agent response generated and persisted in messages table
4. ✅ Session message count updated
5. ✅ Agent response uses conversation context and lead information

**Verification Queries**:
```sql
-- Check both customer and agent messages were stored
SELECT sender_type, content, created_at
FROM messages
WHERE lead_id = (SELECT id FROM leads WHERE external_id = 'test-yelp-lead-123')
ORDER BY created_at;

-- Check session message stats
SELECT message_count, last_message_at, last_message_from
FROM agent_sessions
WHERE lead_id = (SELECT id FROM leads WHERE external_id = 'test-yelp-lead-123');
```

### Scenario 3: Get Agent Responses for External Delivery

**Test**: Verify Zapier can retrieve undelivered agent responses.

**API Call**:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/webhooks/zapier/get-agent-responses/test-yelp-lead-123?limit=5"
```

**Expected Results**:
1. ✅ HTTP 200 response with array of undelivered agent messages
2. ✅ Messages include content, agent_name, created_at, conversation_id
3. ✅ Only messages with `delivery_status != "delivered"` are returned

### Scenario 4: Mark Message as Delivered

**Test**: Verify message delivery status tracking.

**API Call** (replace {message_id} with actual message ID):
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/webhooks/zapier/mark-delivered/{message_id}?external_message_id=yelp-msg-456"
```

**Expected Results**:
1. ✅ HTTP 200 response confirming delivery
2. ✅ Message `delivery_status` updated to "delivered"
3. ✅ Message `delivered_at` timestamp set
4. ✅ External message ID stored

## 🔍 Advanced Testing

### Test Message Router Directly

**API Call**:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/messages/route" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "lead_id": 1,
    "message": "Can you provide more details about your services?",
    "message_type": "text",
    "metadata": {"test": true}
  }'
```

### Test Session Context Retrieval

**API Call**:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/messages/session/1/context"
```

### Test Conversation History

**API Call**:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/messages/conversations/recent?limit=5"
```

## 🎮 Manual Testing with Agent Testing Modal

If you have the frontend running, you can also test through the Agent Testing Modal:

1. **Go to Agents page** → Select your Yelp Lead Specialist agent
2. **Click "Test Agent"** button
3. **Send test messages** to verify agent responds appropriately
4. **Check database** to ensure messages are persisted

## 📊 Monitoring and Debugging

### Check Logs
Monitor the application logs for message generation and routing:

```bash
# If using Docker
docker logs [container-name] -f

# If running locally
tail -f backend/app.log
```

### Database Inspection Queries

**Recent Messages**:
```sql
SELECT
    m.id,
    m.content,
    m.sender_type,
    m.sender_name,
    m.created_at,
    l.name as lead_name,
    l.external_id
FROM messages m
JOIN leads l ON m.lead_id = l.id
ORDER BY m.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Session Statistics**:
```sql
SELECT
    s.id,
    s.message_count,
    s.session_status,
    s.last_message_at,
    a.name as agent_name,
    l.name as lead_name
FROM agent_sessions s
JOIN agents a ON s.agent_id = a.id
JOIN leads l ON s.lead_id = l.id
ORDER BY s.created_at DESC;
```

**Message Delivery Status**:
```sql
SELECT
    delivery_status,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM messages
WHERE sender_type = 'agent'
GROUP BY delivery_status;
```

## 🚨 Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Initial Message Generated
**Symptoms**: Lead and session created, but no initial message
**Check**:
1. Agent has `new_lead` trigger configured
2. Agent is active (`is_active = true`)
3. OpenAI service is available and configured
4. Check application logs for errors

### Issue: Messages Not Persisted
**Symptoms**: API returns success but no messages in database
**Check**:
1. Message table migration was run
2. Database connection is working
3. Check for transaction rollbacks in logs

### Issue: Agent Response Not Generated
**Symptoms**: Incoming message stored but no agent response
**Check**:
1. Session exists and is active
2. Agent prompt template is valid
3. OpenAI API key is configured
4. Check token limits and API errors

### Issue: Variable Replacement Not Working
**Symptoms**: Agent messages contain unreplaced variables like `{first_name}`
**Check**:
1. Lead has required fields populated (first_name, service_requested, etc.)
2. Prompt template uses correct variable format
3. AgentService variable mapping includes all used variables

## ✅ Success Criteria

The implementation is working correctly when:

1. **✅ Lead Creation**: New Yelp leads trigger agent sessions and initial messages
2. **✅ Message Routing**: Incoming messages are routed to correct sessions
3. **✅ Message Persistence**: All messages are stored in the database
4. **✅ Agent Responses**: Agents generate contextual responses using their prompts
5. **✅ Variable Replacement**: Lead data is properly inserted into agent messages
6. **✅ External Integration**: Zapier can retrieve and mark messages as delivered
7. **✅ Session Management**: Session statistics are updated correctly
8. **✅ Error Handling**: Failed operations are logged and don't break the flow

## 🎉 Next Steps

Once all tests pass:

1. **Deploy to Staging**: Test with real Yelp data via Zapier
2. **Configure Zapier Automation**: Set up Zapier to poll for agent responses
3. **Monitor Performance**: Watch response times and error rates
4. **Scale Testing**: Test with multiple concurrent conversations
5. **Phase 4 Planning**: Design chat UI for viewing conversations
