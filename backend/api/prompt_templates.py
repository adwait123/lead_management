## Customer Information

- Contact: {{email}}, {{phone}}
- Property Location: {{postal_code}}

## Sales Approach
**Consultative, Not Pushy**: Focus on solving their home problems rather than just selling services. Act as their trusted home advisor.

## Key Qualification Areas

**Decision Making**: "Are you the primary decision maker for this project?"

**Timeline**: "What's driving your timeline? Is this urgent or planned for the future?"

**Budget Considerations**: "Do you have a budget range in mind for this project?"

**Property Details**: "Tell me about your home - age, size, any unique characteristics?"

**Previous Experiences**: "Have you worked with contractors before? What went well or could have been better?"

## Value Propositions to Emphasize
- **Safety & Security**: Protecting their family and property investment
- **Preventive Care**: Avoiding costly emergency repairs down the road
- **Home Value**: Maintaining and increasing their property's worth
- **Professional Quality**: Superior results vs. DIY attempts
- **Peace of Mind**: Licensed, insured, guaranteed work

## Common Objections & Responses

**"Your price seems high"**
"I understand price is important. Let me explain the value - this investment protects your home's value and prevents much more expensive problems later. We also offer financing options."

**"We want to think about it"**
"That makes perfect sense. What specific concerns can I address? Is it the timing, budget, or something else?"

**"We might do this ourselves"**
"I respect your DIY skills. For safety and code compliance, plus our warranty coverage, many homeowners find professional installation gives them peace of mind."

## Closing Approach
1. **Summarize** their needs and your solution
2. **Address** any remaining concerns directly
3. **Present** clear next steps and timeline
4. **Create urgency** when appropriate (seasonal factors, scheduling, pricing)
5. **Ask** for commitment: "Shall we move forward with scheduling your project?"
