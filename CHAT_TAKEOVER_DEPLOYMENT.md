## 🔧 **Backend Changes** (REQUIRES DEPLOYMENT)

### **New API Endpoints Added:**
- `POST /api/messages/session/{session_id}/takeover` - Take over session from agent
- `POST /api/messages/session/{session_id}/release` - Release session back to agent
- `GET /api/messages/session/{session_id}/status` - Get session status and control info
- `GET /api/messages/conversation/{lead_external_id}` - Get complete conversation (agent + lead messages)

### **Modified Files:**

## 🚀 **Deployment Instructions**

### **Step 1: Deploy Backend to Staging**
```bash
# Push backend changes to staging
git add backend/api/messages.py backend/api/webhooks.py
git commit -m "Add chat takeover functionality and conversation endpoints

- Add session takeover/release API endpoints
- Add complete conversation history endpoint
- Modify webhook to respect takeover status
- Prevent agent auto-response when taken over"

git push origin staging
```

### **Step 2: Update Frontend Environment**
Update frontend to use staging API base URL instead of localhost:8000

### **Step 3: Test Staging Deployment**
1. **Create test lead** via staging webhook endpoint
2. **Simulate conversation** with lead messages
3. **Test takeover functionality** in staging environment
4. **Verify agent stops responding** after takeover

## 🧪 **Test Case Ready**

### **Complete Test Lead Created:**
- **External ID**: `test-takeover-demo-001`
- **Lead Name**: John Takeover
- **Service**: Kitchen Remodeling
- **Messages**: 5 total (3 agent, 2 lead messages)

### **Test URLs (Update for Staging):**
- **Main App**: `https://your-staging-url.com`
- **Conversations**: `https://your-staging-url.com/conversations`
- **Test Lead Chat**: `https://your-staging-url.com/leads/4/chat`

### **Test Workflow:**
1. ✅ Navigate to conversation with John Takeover
2. ✅ Verify complete conversation displays (5 messages total)
3. ✅ See green "Agent is managing" banner
4. ✅ Click "Take Over" button
5. ✅ Verify orange "You have taken over" banner appears
6. ✅ Send test lead message - verify NO agent auto-response
7. ✅ Click "Return to Agent" to release control
8. ✅ Send another lead message - verify agent DOES respond

## 📊 **Expected Conversation Display:**

```
🤖 Agent: Hi John, thank you for reaching out! It sounds like you're looking to schedule a kitchen remodeling project with new cabinets and countertops. To move forward, I have two great time slots available: Tomorrow at 2:00 PM or Thursday at 10:00 AM. Which works better for you? - Mike

👤 Lead: Hi Mike! Thursday at 10:00 AM works perfectly for me. Can you tell me a bit more about the process? Also, do you provide free estimates?

🤖 Agent: That's great, John! On Thursday at 10:00 AM, our team will discuss your kitchen remodeling needs, provide design options, and answer any questions you may have. While we don't offer free estimates, our standard kitchen consultation fee is $125, which is credited towards any work performed. Looking forward to meeting you on Thursday!

👤 Lead: That sounds fair about the consultation fee. One more question - do you have any photos of recent kitchen projects you could share? I want to get an idea of your work quality.

🤖 Agent: I'm only able to answer questions about <business_name/>'s services. Let me know if you need help with that!
```

## ⚠️ **Critical Success Criteria:**

1. **✅ Both agent AND lead messages display** (not just agent messages)
2. **✅ Scrolling works properly** in chat interface
3. **✅ Take Over button functions** and calls real API
4. **✅ Agent stops responding** when session is taken over
5. **✅ Visual status indicators** clearly show who's in control
6. **✅ Return to Agent** releases control and agent resumes responding

## 🔗 **Dependencies:**
- **Database**: No schema changes required (uses existing session fields)
- **Environment**: Staging API must be deployed before frontend testing
- **Authentication**: Uses existing authentication (no new requirements)
